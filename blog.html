    <h1>There are three types of requirement questions</h1>
    <h4>1.What is the difference between map,filter,foreach and find?</h4>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.It Calls a function once for each element in an array.Then does not execute the function for empty element and change the original array.</li>
            <li>forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array and it is not executed for empty elements.</li>
            <li> find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test  executes a function for each array element.It also returns undefined if no elements are found.Does not execute the function for empty elements and does not change the original array</li>
            <li>The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.This method also does not execute the function for empty elements and does not change the original array.  </li>
        </ul>
     </p>
    <h4>2.What is the difference between localStorage,sessionStorage and cookies?</h4>
       <ul>
        <li><span>localStorage</span>5mb or 10mb storage,its not session based,need to be deleted via JS or manually,client side reading only and less older browser support </li>
        <li><span>sessionStorage</span>5mb storage, Expiry depends on the setting  and working per window or tab,client side reading only and less older browser support </li>
        <li><span>cookies</span>4kb storage,it's  session based, and working per window or tab,server and client side reading . More older browser support </li>
       </ul>
    <h4>3.what is Event loop and how does its work?</h4>
     <p>
        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
        Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the callback queue can be put on the call stack.setTimeout()and setInterval() method work for this.Thats why its work asynchronous way.

     <h4>why used quizTimer function in noChange.js?</h4>
     <p>I think this function used for counting time.How many time to take for answering six questions.
        if limited time crossed then show one color,otherwise show different color.
     </p>
     <h4>why used  chooseQuiz function in noChange.js?</h4>
